# Megaline Model

## Overview
This README provides an overview of the project focused on transitioning subscribers to newer plans based on subscriber behavior data analysis.

## Description
The project aims to leverage subscriber behavior data to recommend suitable plan transitions from legacy plans to newer, advanced plans (Smart or Ultra) offered by Megaline. The approach involves developing a sophisticated model using machine learning techniques to analyze subscriber data and predict the most appropriate plan upgrade for each subscriber.

## Objectives
- Data Analysis: Utilize statistical methods to preprocess subscriber behavior data.
- Model Development: Build a predictive model using machine learning algorithms (e.g., DecisionTreeClassifier) to recommend plan transitions.
- Accuracy Target: Achieve a model accuracy exceeding the 75% threshold set by Megaline.
- Implementation: Provide actionable insights to facilitate plan transition strategies for Megaline's subscriber base.

## Conclusion
The project successfully developed a predictive model using the `DecisionTreeClassifier` algorithm, achieving an accuracy score of 81.33% on a separate test dataset. This outcome surpassed the project's accuracy target and identified 120 errors during testing, contributing to ongoing model refinement.

## Libraries
The following libraries were used in this project:
